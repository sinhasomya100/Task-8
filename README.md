Interview Questions & Answers 
1. What does a dashboard do? 
A dashboard visually summarizes key data metrics in one place, helping users quickly understand 
patterns, trends, and insights. My dashboard highlights sales performance across products, regions, 
and categories to support business decisions.

2. How do you choose the right chart? 
The chart type depends on the data: 
• I used a line chart for monthly sales to show trends over time. 
• A bar chart to compare sales across regions. 
• A donut chart for category-wise sales distribution. This ensures clarity and makes patterns 
easier to spot.

3. What is a slicer/filter? 
A slicer is an interactive tool that allows users to filter data based on specific fields. In my dashboard, 
I used a Region slicer so users can view how different areas performed individually.

4. Why do we use KPIs? 
KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) help track progress toward business goals. Although I didn’t 
include a specific KPI card, the visuals show top-performing products, peak sales months, and 
regional contributions, which act as performance indicators.

5. What did your dashboard show about sales? 
It showed that: 
• E-books and budgeting tools were the top-selling products. 
• December 2024 had the highest sales, followed by a steady decline. 
• UK and Canada led in regional sales. 
• Health & Wellness and Productivity were the most profitable categories.

6. How do you make a dashboard look clean? 
I used: 
• Consistent colors and fonts 
• Minimal visual clutter 
• Proper titles and labels 
• Balanced layout of charts and slicers 
This helps users focus on insights, not just visuals.

7. Did you clean the data before starting? 
Yes. I ensured: 
• Dates were in the right format 
• Nulls or duplicates were removed 
• Sales and profit fields were numeric 
This prepared the data for accurate analysis and visualization.
